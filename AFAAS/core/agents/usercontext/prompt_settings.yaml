        " - **Context-aware**: The goal should be aware of and clearly define the context in which the AI is expected to function. This is especially important if the AI has a limited understanding of the world or the domain in which it operates.",
        " - **Explicitness**: The goal must explicitly state what the AI needs to do. There should be no hidden assumptions or implied requirements. Everything that the AI needs to know to complete the goal should be explicitly stated.",

Please use your capabilities to ensure that the user's goal aligns with these principles by generating questions that guide him closer to our expectations in term of user requirement expression.",

        "2. **No Assumptions**: NEVER make assumptions. Always align with the user's original expressions.",
        "3. **Adhere to COCE**: Your reformulations, questions, and interactions should aim to get the user's requirements to fit the COCE Framework.",

## Instructions

An Autonomous agent backed by a Large Language Model (LLM) is charged with performing a task. Because he has limited context awareness we are writing a memo. You are charged to write the next paragraph ("History") and select the relevant UML diagram that would help him to perform its tasks. 

## Current memo

"""
Your task is :
{{ to_md_quotation(task.long_description) }}

## Context

This task is part of a projects and is located as follow in the WBS :

{% for parent in task_path %}{% if loop.index > 1 %}{{ '\t' * (loop.index - 1) }}->{% endif %}{{ parent.task_goal }} ({{ parent.task_id }})
{% endfor %}{# 
  #}{% if task_sibblings %}{#  
          #}{% for sibbling in task_sibblings %}{{ '\t' * task_path|length }}{{ sibbling.task_goal }} (({{ sibbling.task_id }})): {{ sibbling.state }}
{#        #}{% endfor %}{# 
  #}{% endif %}
"""
 
{% if task_history %}
## Historic

These are the last task completed (maximum {{task_history|length}} tasks):

{% for task in task_history %}{{ loop.index }}. {{ task.task_goal }} ({{ task.task_id }}) gave following results : 
{{ to_md_quotation(task.task_text_output) }}
{% if task.task_text_output_as_uml %}```plantuml
{{ task.task_text_output_as_uml }}
```{% endif %}
{% endfor %}{% endif %}

## Rules

- Be factual & precise : Keep as many IDs, file paths, class Names, person Names, ect... To perform the task.
- Avoid repetitions : If there is a redundance between a textual description and a UML description keep the UML version

        ‚ö†Ô∏è Please do not prefix your Title with "Bug" , "Fix" , our CI does it ‚ö†Ô∏è

        Provide a meanful title that leaves to no ambiguity

  - type: markdown
    attributes:
      value: |
        Please confirm that the issue you have is described well and precise in the title above ‚¨ÜÔ∏è.
        A good rule of thumb: What would you type if you were searching for the issue?
        
        For example:
        BAD - my AFAAS keeps looping
        GOOD - After performing execute_python_file, AFAAS goes into a loop where it keeps trying to execute the file.
        
        ‚ö†Ô∏è SUPER-busy repo, please help the volunteer maintainers.
        The less time we spend here, the more time we can spend building AFAAS.
        
        Please help us help you by following these steps:
        - Search for existing issues, adding a comment when you have the same or similar issue is tidier than "new issue" and 
          newer issues will not be reviewed earlier, this is dependent on the current priorities set by our wonderful team
        - Provide relevant info:
          - Provide commit-hash (`git rev-parse HEAD` gets it) if possible
          - If it's a pip/packages issue, mention this in the title and provide pip version, python version
          - If it's a crash, provide traceback and describe the error you got as precise as possible in the title.

This temporary license is granted to any individual receiving a copy of the software and its accompanying documentation files (the "Software"). The purpose of this license is to allow individuals to use, analyze, review, and contribute to the development of the Software, while ensuring contributors are protected from potential legal issues.

It is crucial to clarify that this license is designed as a stopgap measure, intended to remain in effect only until the initial official release of the Software under a permissive open-source license. Once the official release occurs, this license will be supplanted or revised. All users and contributors are required to consult the updated licensing terms to gain a comprehensive understanding of their rights and responsibilities.

Under this temporary license, you are authorized to use, examine, and make contributions to the Software for bug identification, research, and critical assessment. However, please note that any actions beyond these outlined permissions, including but not limited to modification, merging, publication, distribution, or sale of copies of the Software, are explicitly prohibited at this stage.

It's important to emphasize that the ultimate goal of this project is to transition to an open-source and permissive licensing model, such as the MIT License, in the long term. This transition will enable broader use, modification, distribution, and integration of the Software with other projects, aligning with the principles of the open-source community.

# afaas: Agent Framework as a Service

Welcome to the **afaas: Agent Framework as a Service** project! This project is a fork **AutoGPT** it aims to facilitate developments of AI Agents & AI Autonomous Agents by providing a more simple, modular & extendable architecture.

This is a Project Presentation & a product presentation will be released soon.

## Quick Start

Follow these simple steps to get started with **afaas**:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ph-ausseil/afaas.git
   cd afaas
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install poetry
   poetry install
   ```

3. **Run the Agent**

   ```bash
   poetry run demo
   ```

## Status

Autonomous Agent are experimental initiative aiming to set inteligent systems with more or less human involvement. We will try to push research and knowledge beyond what is currently done by AutoGPT, TaskWeaver & AutoGen while providing a service such as ones provided by GPTPilot & Aider.

The project will come with a Framework anyone can extend, an agent anyone can extend @ an app to play with

and provide additional functionalities, namely : 

1. **Separate Agent Functionalities**: Facilitate teamwork by dividing agent functionalities into four parts:
   - **Agent Main**: Focuses on UI ↔ Agent ↔ Database interfaces, supporting CRUD & Execution.
   - **Agent Loop**: Concentrates on the Agent execution logic.
   - **Agent Models**: Gather Settings and Configurations required to run an Agent. 
   - **Agent Strategies**: Emphasizes the creation of (dynamic) prompts for the Machine Learning Back-end.

2. **Support Multiple Users**: Allows multi-user, so you can provide your agent via an API/Service to multiple persons/programs.

3. **Support Multiple Agent Instances**: Enables work on different projects.

4. **Support Various Agent Types**: Facilitates the creation of specialist agents.

5. **Support Various Memory Back-ends**: Including AWS, Azure, and MongoDB.

<!--🚧 **Work in progress**: Please check the branch status for further information. 🚧

## Tutorials

Adoption is the most important thing, and we have a strong commitment to implement comprehensive tutorials & guides, we also provide templates you can copy to implement you agents. We are in the process of creating a comprehensive tutorial to guide developers.

- **Tutorial Location**: All tutorial files are located in the `./tutorials` directory. 
- **Templates**: Template files are provided in the `./tutorials/templates` directory **70/100**  (Under Construction) 🚧
- **How to Use**: Navigate to the `./tutorials` directory to find step-by-step guides. Utilize the templates in the `./tutorials/templates` directory to get a head start in implementing your custom strategies and loop logic.**35/100**  (Under Construction) 🚧

Stay tuned for updates as we continue to build out this tutorial section to assist developers in effectively utilizing the afaas framework.

## Current status

27th of September : 
The Framework libraries are working, we are currently achieving an example of Agent implemented with the Framework and compatible with the [Agent Protocol](https://github.com/AI-Engineers-Foundation/agent-protocol) & AutoGPT Benchmarks other priorities are the support of more "Abilities" (tools 🔧 ), database-backends ( 📚 ).

## Contributing

Your contributions to this project are immensely valued. Here are currents needs : 
- **Anyone** with skills in Kubernetes :smile:
- **Back-End Developer :**
  - Join us to migrate AutoGPT Commands to Abilities
  - Join us to achieve the prototyped backends (AWS, Azure, MongoDB).
- **Front-end Developper**
  - Join us to develop a GUI
  - Join us to build a Project Website 
- Also **Anyone :** 
  - Join us to manage PR & Discord Server
  - ✅ ~~Build a User Guide to run our example.~~ => AutoGPT User Guide should

  - Build a Technical documentation to documents all the technical intricacies of the Framework
  - Offer suggestions, report potential issues, or propose new enhancements through GitHub issues.

For more detailed contribution guidelines, please refer to `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Roadmap priorities : 
1. 🔄 Achieve the SimpleAgent example
2. 🔴 Compatibility with  [Agent Protocol](https://github.com/AI-Engineers-Foundation/agent-protocol) 
3. 🔴 Migrate AutoGPT Commands to Abilities **Help needed**
4. 🔴 Get a Developper Guide for easier adoption

## Setup and Execution

We recommend using AutoGPT guidelines.

## Our modules

As a developper of agents you would only need to focus on `core/agents` & eventualy `core/tools`. Advanced developper may intergrate new memory backends, new machine learning models in `core/resource`.
